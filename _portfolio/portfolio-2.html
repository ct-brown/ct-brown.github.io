<h2>Disparities in the U.S. Ecosocial Safety Net</h2>

<p>This research stream examines how climate adaptation and disaster relief systems intersect with existing social inequalities in the United States. Through quantitative analysis of administrative data and qualitative case studies, I trace how federal and philanthropic disaster response creates a bifurcated "public-private" ecowelfare system that amplifies rather than reduces vulnerability.</p>

<h3>Key Projects:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Divided Ecowelfare State:</strong> Maps how corporate disaster philanthropy and federal relief form a highly centralized system across major U.S. disasters, with differential access based on race, class, and geography</li>

<li><strong>Adapting the Safety Net:</strong> Tests how disasters reshape enrollment in TANF, SNAP, UI, LIHEAP, and Medicaid—revealing whether climate-adapted programs absorb or amplify enrollment shocks</li>

<li><strong>Fueling Ecowelfare:</strong> Builds a global typology of energy and utility assistance as "regressive offsetting," showing how program designs shape energy poverty and just-transition feasibility</li>
</ul>

<h3>Methods:</h3>
<p>Administrative data analysis, difference-in-differences estimation, event-history modeling, comparative policy analysis</p>
