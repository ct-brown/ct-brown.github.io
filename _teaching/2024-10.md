In this workshop, we provide an introduction to machine learning in Python. First, we'll cover some machine learning basics, including its foundational principles. Then, we'll dive into code, understanding how to perform regression, regularization, preprocessing, and classification. There are additional components of the workshop which explore building machine learning pipelines and unsupervised learning. We'll demonstrate how to perform these tasks using scikit-learn, the main package used for machine learning in Python.
