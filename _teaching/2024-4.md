This six-part interactive workshop series is your complete introduction to programming Python for people with little or no previous programming experience, with a focus on data science application. In Parts 1-3, we cover the basics of Python and Jupyter, variables and data types, and a gentle introduction to data analysis in Pandas. In Parts 4-6, we cover loops and conditionals, creating your own functions, analysis and visualization in Pandas, and the workflow of a data science project.
