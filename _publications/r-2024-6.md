This study investigates the social policy arrangement in rentier states, focusing on the potential shift from centralised, étatist governance toward more liberal-pluralist or neo-corporatist structures. Using the case study of the social security system in Qatar, the hypothesis suggests that globalisation, economic diversification, and increasing demands for broader stakeholder engagement might facilitate this transformation. However, the findings reveal that social policy arrangements remain predominantly étatist, with the state retaining centralised control over discourse, actors, resources, and rules. Although elements of pluralism—such as civil society and international actor involvement—are emerging, their influence remains limited. This research underscores the resilience of étatist structures in rentier states, where global governance norms are selectively incorporated without fundamentally altering centralised governance. The case study reflects gradual changes driven by modernisation and external pressures but suggests no immediate shift in the overall policy framework.
