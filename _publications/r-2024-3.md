We apply a synthesis review to revisit the concept, measurement, and operationalization of social inclusion and exclusion in the context of comparative social policy, integrating the vast literature on the concepts, with the aim of elucidating a clearer understanding of the concepts for use by scholars and policymakers around the planet. In turn, we outline the conceptual development of the concepts, how they have been operationalized through social policy, and how they have been measured at the national and individual levels. Through our review, we identify limitations to extant conceptualization and measurement approaches that emphasize the conceptsâ€™ multidimensional, multilevel, dynamic, and relational essence and highlight its connection to related concepts like social capital, social integration, and social citizenship.
