*When Helping Hurts* argues that modern welfare systems don’t just manage social risk; they also function as climate adaptation—what I call *ecowelfare*. Under crisis governance, repair often cycles back into markets—“*growth-as-adaptation*”—through temporary *ecodecommodification* of labor/land during disaster and *recommodification* in recovery.

While the dissertation is in long (book) format, it includes three empirical chapters:
1. Comparative computational analysis and symptomatic reading of 209 countries' National Adaptation Plans to map state ideaologies and policy logics of adaptation;
2. Ecowelfare state typology of 62 countries using a global, SDG-based index of ecodecommodification and model-based clustering.
3. Causal, generalized synthetic control difference-in-differences study of the moderating effect of ecowelfare on growth after major U.S. hurricanes.

The aim of the dissertation is to develop a framework for *ecosocial adaptation*—-designing safety nets that meet need without defaulting to growth-as-adaptation.
