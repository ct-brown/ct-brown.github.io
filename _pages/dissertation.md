<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin: 0;"><em>When Helping Hurts</em> argues that modern welfare systems don't just manage social risk—they also function as climate adaptation infrastructure, what I call <strong>ecowelfare</strong>. Under crisis governance, repair often cycles back into markets through <strong>growth-as-adaptation</strong>: temporary ecodecommodification of labor and land during disaster, followed by recommodification in recovery.</p>
</div>

## The Argument

Climate adaptation is increasingly embedded within existing welfare institutions. Rather than fundamentally transforming how we organize care and production, states mobilize social protection to stabilize disaster-affected populations and return them to market participation. This creates a paradox: the more we adapt through welfare systems, the more we may entrench the growth imperatives driving ecological crisis.

The dissertation develops **ecosocial adaptation** as an alternative framework—designing safety nets that meet human needs without defaulting to growth-as-repair.

## Three Empirical Studies

The dissertation uses mixed methods to examine ecowelfare across scales:

### 1. Global Climate Adaptation Ideologies
<div style="background-color: #e8f4e8; padding: 1.5em; margin: 1em 0; border-radius: 6px;">
<p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Method:</strong> Comparative computational analysis and symptomatic reading of 209 countries' National Adaptation Plans</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0 0 0;"><strong>Question:</strong> What ideologies and policy logics shape how states conceptualize climate adaptation?</p>
</div>

This chapter maps the political economy of national adaptation strategies, revealing how growth paradigms structure adaptation planning even in contexts claiming "sustainable development" or "resilience."

### 2. Ecowelfare State Typology
<div style="background-color: #e8f0f4; padding: 1.5em; margin: 1em 0; border-radius: 6px;">
<p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Method:</strong> Global SDG-based index of ecodecommodification across 62 countries, analyzed through model-based clustering</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0 0 0;"><strong>Question:</strong> How do nations vary in their integration of ecological and social protection systems?</p>
</div>

Building on Esping-Andersen's welfare state typologies, this chapter develops the first systematic classification of ecowelfare regimes, identifying distinct models of climate-social protection integration.

### 3. Ecowelfare and Post-Disaster Growth
<div style="background-color: #f4ebe8; padding: 1.5em; margin: 1em 0; border-radius: 6px;">
<p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Method:</strong> Causal analysis using generalized synthetic control difference-in-differences</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5em 0 0 0;"><strong>Question:</strong> How do ecowelfare systems moderate economic growth imperatives after major hurricanes in the United States?</p>
</div>

This chapter provides causal evidence that stronger social protection can dampen post-disaster growth pressures, but only under specific institutional conditions—suggesting pathways toward ecosocial adaptation.

## Theoretical Framework

The dissertation synthesizes multiple traditions:

- **Critical Political Economy**: Analyzing capital accumulation and crisis governance
- **Welfare State Theory**: Extending decommodification to ecological systems
- **Social Reproduction Theory**: Understanding care labor in climate contexts
- **Environmental Justice**: Centering equity in adaptation governance
- **Degrowth Studies**: Exploring post-growth alternatives to growth-as-adaptation

---

## Key Concepts

**Ecowelfare**: The integration of climate adaptation within welfare state institutions and social protection systems.

**Growth-as-Adaptation**: Policy patterns where climate repair functions primarily to restore market participation and economic growth rather than meet human needs directly.

**Ecodecommodification**: The degree to which people can maintain wellbeing independent of both labor markets *and* ecological extraction.

**Ecosocial Adaptation**: Climate adaptation strategies that meet needs through social protection while challenging rather than reproducing growth imperatives.

## Format & Timeline

The dissertation follows a long-form (book) structure, integrating theoretical development with empirical analysis. Expected completion: 2026.
