<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin: 0;"><em>When Helping Hurts</em> argues that modern welfare systems don't just manage social risk—they also function as climate adaptation infrastructure ("ecowelfare"), and under crisis governance they often cycle repair back into markets through <strong>growth-as-adaptation</strong>: temporary eco(de)commodification during disaster, followed by recommodification in recovery.</p>
</div>

## Core Claim

Climate adaptation is increasingly embedded in existing welfare institutions—less as transformation than as crisis management that stabilizes populations and restores market participation. This produces a paradox: as climate risk intensifies, welfare-based adaptation can become more necessary and more likely to reinforce the growth logics that help drive ecological crisis.

## What the Dissertation Does

A book-length dissertation that develops a critical theory of ecowelfare and tests it empirically across global and U.S. contexts—linking adaptation governance, social protection, and growth.

## Empirical Studies (Across Scales)

### 1. Global Climate Adaptation Ideologies (National Adaptation Plans)

**Question:** What policy logics organize "adaptation," and what gets systematically sidelined?

**Approach:** Computational text analysis (topic modeling + embeddings) combined with symptomatic reading across an adaptation-planning corpus covering 209 countries/territories.

**Payoff:** A classificatory map of adaptation logics—especially where growth-centered "resilience" displaces decommodified care.

---

### 2. Ecowelfare State Typology (Global Regimes of Eco(de)commodification)

**Question:** How do countries vary in how they integrate ecological governance and social protection?

**Approach:** Build an SDG-indicator architecture for eco(de)commodification (PCA-based indices) and use model-based clustering (Gaussian mixture models) to identify ecowelfare types.

**Payoff:** A comparative regime framework that links welfare capacity and ecological governance to vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and emissions.

### 3. Ecowelfare and Post-Disaster Growth (United States)

**Question:** After major hurricanes, do expansions in U.S. climate-adapted welfare and ecowelfare programs causally increase (or reshape) growth trajectories?

**Approach:** Generalized synthetic control DiD to estimate dynamic treatment effects of hurricanes and the moderating role of Disaster-UI and FEMA/NFIP-style ecowelfare.

**Payoff:** A causal test of growth-as-adaptation—when welfare dampens growth pressure, when it amplifies recommodification, and under what institutional conditions.

## Theoretical Framework

This dissertation is explicitly theory-driven: it builds a critical account of how states govern climate crisis through welfare institutions—linking adaptation to accumulation, legitimation, and ecoregulation as core functions of the ecowelfare state.

It synthesizes: **critical political economy**, **welfare state theory**, **social reproduction theory**, **environmental justice**, and **post-/degrowth theory**—using theory to specify mechanisms (eco(de/re)commodification) that the empirical chapters then operationalize and test.
