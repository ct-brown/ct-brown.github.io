**Overview.** *When Helping Hurts* argues that modern welfare systems don’t just manage social risk; they also function as climate adaptation—what I call **ecowelfare**. Under crisis governance, repair often cycles back into markets—“**growth-as-adaptation**”—through temporary **ecodecommodification** of labor/land during disaster and **recommodification** in recovery.

**Design (three studies).**
1. Comparative analysis of National Adaptation Plans to map state logics of adaptation.
2. Global, SDG-based typology measuring ecodecommodification.
3. Causal study of U.S. hurricanes testing whether expansions in Disaster-UI, FEMA IHP, and NFIP accelerate output and employment.

**Aim.** Toward a framework for **ecosocial adaptation**—designing safety nets that meet need without defaulting to growth dependence.
