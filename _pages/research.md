My research examines how climate risk reshapes social protection systems and how adaptation policy can either reproduce or challenge growth-dependent economies. I work at the intersection of social welfare, critical theory, and climate policy, using mixed methods to understand global patterns of ecosocial governance.

## Dissertation: When Helping Hurts

My dissertation develops the concept of **ecowelfare**—the integration of climate adaptation within welfare state institutions. I argue that crisis governance often cycles repair back into markets through what I call **growth-as-adaptation**: temporary decommodification of labor and land during disasters, followed by recommodification in recovery.

## Research Streams

### 1. Ecowelfare States & Climate Adaptation

How do nations integrate climate adaptation with social protection? I'm developing a global typology of ecowelfare states using SDG-based indicators of ecodecommodification and analyzing the institutional structures that shape adaptation politics.

**Key Projects:**
- Global ecowelfare state typology (62 countries)
- Comparative analysis of national adaptation plans (209 countries)
- Climate risk and welfare state transformation

**Methods:** Model-based clustering, computational text analysis, comparative political economy

### 2. Climate Disasters & Economic Growth

How do welfare systems moderate growth imperatives after climate disasters? Using causal inference methods, I examine how social protection shapes economic recovery trajectories following major hurricanes in the United States.

**Key Projects:**
- Generalized synthetic control analysis of welfare effects post-disaster
- Growth-as-adaptation in hurricane recovery
- Disaster capitalism and social policy

**Methods:** Difference-in-differences, synthetic control, econometric modeling

### 3. Climate Ideology & Policy Discourse

What ideologies shape national climate adaptation strategies? I use computational methods to analyze how states frame adaptation in official policy documents, revealing underlying assumptions about growth, development, and social protection.

**Key Projects:**
- Symptomatic reading of 209 National Adaptation Plans
- Discourse analysis of climate adaptation frameworks
- Political economy of adaptation planning

**Methods:** Natural language processing, topic modeling, critical discourse analysis

### 4. Ecosocial Policy & Practice

How can communities build adaptation systems that meet needs without defaulting to growth-as-repair? Through the Center for Ecosocial Policy, I work to translate research into practical frameworks for just climate adaptation.

**Key Projects:**
- Center for Ecosocial Policy development
- Community climate education and organizing
- Ecosocial policy implementation frameworks

**Approach:** Participatory action research, policy co-design, community organizing

## Theoretical Contributions

My work bridges multiple theoretical traditions:

- **Critical Political Economy**: Analyzing how climate adaptation reproduces or challenges capitalist growth imperatives
- **Social Reproduction Theory**: Understanding care, labor, and social protection in climate contexts
- **Degrowth & Post-Growth**: Exploring alternatives to growth-as-adaptation
- **Environmental Justice**: Centering equity and power in adaptation governance
- **Welfare State Theory**: Extending decommodification concepts to ecological systems
