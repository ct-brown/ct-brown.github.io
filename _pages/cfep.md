<div class="callout-box">
<p>From neighborhood classrooms to city hall, we turn community knowledge into ecosocial climate policy and practice—so adaptation doesn't just "bounce back," but builds a just and livable future.</p>
</div>

## Our Model: The Policy Pipeline

<div class="pipeline-text">
<strong>LEARN → ORGANIZE → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → EVALUATE</strong><br>
<span style="color: #666;">Climate literacy → Community priorities → Policy co-design → On-the-ground support → Impact learning</span>
</div>

We equip communities with practical climate knowledge, translate lived experience into actionable policy priorities, co-design solutions with partners, and support implementation and evaluation so policies deliver real, equitable outcomes.

## Why "Ecosocial"?

Climate risk is never "just" environmental—it's social, political, and economic. Effective adaptation requires integrated systems of **infrastructure and care**: cooling centers and flood protection alongside housing security, income support, healthcare access, and worker protections.

**Ecosocial adaptation means meeting human needs while transforming the systems that produce vulnerability in the first place.**
