From neighborhood classrooms to city hall: we turn community knowledge into climate policy and practice. We work toward *a just and livable future through climate adaptation that transforms the systems driving ecological and social harm.*

## Our Model: The Pipeline
**Learn → Organize → Plan → Implement → Evaluate.**  
We equip communities with practical climate knowledge, organize that knowledge into policy priorities, co-design policy with partners, and help implement and evaluate those policies so they deliver real, equitable outcomes.

## Two Complementary Arms

### The Ecosocial Commons — 501(c)(3)
**Mission.** *To empower communities with the knowledge and tools for climate adaptation, building a collaborative network dedicated to healing ecological and social systems.*

### The Center for Ecosocial Policy — 501(c)(4)
**Mission.** *To mobilize a powerful network of advocates to champion, enact, and implement the transformative policies needed to advance climate adaptation.*

## Why “Ecosocial”?
Climate risk is never “just” environmental—-it’s social. Effective adaptation requires systems of *productive infrastructure and care*: cooling and flood projects *and* income support, housing, health, and worker protections. We aim to design this whole-system response with those most affected, aligning mitigation, adaptation, and social policy so communities can thrive.

*Ecosocial Collective unites education, organizing, and policy implementation so communities can adapt—fairly, fast, and for the long term.*
