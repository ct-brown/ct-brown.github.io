<strong>From neighborhood classrooms to city hall:</strong> we turn community knowledge into climate policy and practice. We work toward <em>a just and livable future through climate adaptation that transforms the systems driving ecological and social harm.</em>

We equip communities with practical climate knowledge, organize that knowledge into policy priorities, co-design policy with partners, and help implement and evaluate those policies so they deliver real, equitable outcomes.

## Why "Ecosocial"?

Climate risk is never "just" environmental—it's fundamentally social. Effective adaptation requires integrated systems of **productive infrastructure and care**: cooling centers and flood protection *alongside* income support, housing, healthcare, and worker protections.

**Key Principles:**

- **Integration**: Linking climate adaptation with social protection systems
- **Justice**: Centering those most affected by climate impacts in policy design
- **Transformation**: Moving beyond market-based solutions to address root causes
- **Community Leadership**: Building power through education and organizing
- **Whole-System Response**: Addressing ecological and social dimensions together

## Current Initiatives

### 🌱 Community Climate Workshops
Building climate literacy through accessible, community-led education programs that connect local experience with policy frameworks.

### 📊 Policy Research & Analysis
Translating academic research into practical policy recommendations grounded in community priorities and environmental justice principles.

### 🤝 Coalition Building
Developing networks of community organizations, researchers, and policymakers working toward ecosocial climate adaptation.

### 📝 Policy Co-Design
Working directly with communities and local governments to develop and implement adaptation policies that meet real needs.
