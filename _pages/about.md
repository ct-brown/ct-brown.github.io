I’m a fourth-year PhD candidate in Social Welfare and Critical Theory at UC Berkeley.

I study ecosocial policy and the ecowelfare state: how climate risk reshapes welfare institutions—-and how adaptation can either entrench or unsettle growth. My work blends econometrics and computational methods with comparative political economy and critical theory. I’m a social worker by training and have served in micro- and macro-practice roles in social and environmental policy across levels of the public and private sectors. I'm also the founder of the Ecosocial Collective, a nonprofit grassroots ecosocial policy service, education, and policy incubator.

When I’m not writing or teaching, I’m with my spouse, friends, and our Labrador, Indigo. I grew up near Paragould, Arkansas, and I love rock climbing, pottery, painting, poetry, travel, and exploring new wines and teas.

See my CV, current projects, and notes on this site. Get in touch--I’d love to connect.
