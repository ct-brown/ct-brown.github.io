I'm a PhD candidate in Social Welfare and Critical Theory at UC Berkeley and the founding Executive Director of the [Center for Ecosocial Policy](/esc/), a nonprofit advancing just climate adaptation through community education, organizing, and policy implementation.

## Research

My research focuses on **ecosocial policy and the ecowelfare state**: how climate risk reshapes welfare institutions, and how adaptation can either entrench or unsettle growth. I blend econometrics and computational methods with comparative political economy and critical theory to understand how social protection systems function as climate adaptation.

My dissertation, [*When Helping Hurts: Growth, Adaptation, and a Critique of Ecowelfare*](/dissertation/), examines how modern welfare systems operate as climate adaptation infrastructure—what I call *ecowelfare*—and develops a framework for ecosocial adaptation that meets human needs without defaulting to growth-as-repair.

## Background

I'm a social worker by training and have served in micro- and macro-practice roles across social and environmental policy in the public and private sectors. My work connects grassroots practice with critical policy analysis, bridging community organizing and academic research.

## Current Projects

- **Ecowelfare State Typology**: Developing a global classification system for how nations integrate climate adaptation with social protection
- **Climate Disaster & Economic Growth**: Analyzing how welfare systems moderate growth imperatives after major hurricanes
- **National Adaptation Plans**: Computational analysis of climate adaptation ideologies across 209 countries
- **Center for Ecosocial Policy**: Building a pipeline from community climate education to policy implementation

When I'm not writing or teaching, I'm with my spouse, friends, and our Labrador, Indigo. I grew up near Paragould, Arkansas, and I love rock climbing, pottery, painting, poetry, travel, and exploring new wines and teas.

**Let's connect.** I'm always interested in collaboration, speaking opportunities, and conversations about ecosocial policy and climate justice.
